# Interview
In order for us to get a better grasp on your programming abilities, please perform the two tasks below.  They’re fairly simple, but they allow me to get a glimpse of how you solve problems and implement solutions.  Feel free to add additional features.  “Scope creep” is encouraged if it enables you to better highlight your coding proficiency.  Have fun with this, and show us what you can do.
1.	Write a simple Java or C# program that draws ASCII shapes

a.	It should take at least these inputs, but it could take more.  It should be almost impossible to crash the program through bad input.

i.	Which shape to draw – the choices should include triangle, square, and diamond.

ii.	Height of the shape

   iii.	Text label to display
1.	Choosing the label should be optional for the user.
2.	Default: “LU”
iv.	Row on which to display text label
1.	Choosing the label row should be optional for the user.
2.	Default: 4
v.	The option to repeat at the end.
b.	A sample run might go something like this:
c.	Possible Bonus Tasks:
i.	Allow multiple text labels on multiple different lines.
ii.	Add more options for shapes. (square, circle, rectangle, smiley face , etc.)

2.	Design a brand new database that would store information about people. The expected number of people to be stored in this database is over 1,000,000. You need to store the following information:
a.	SSN
b.	Name
c.	Birth date
d.	Ethnicity
e.	US Address Info (needs to store several: home, work, etc.)
f.	Phone Info (needs to store several: home, work, etc.)   
g.	Donation Type (Cash, Check, Credit Card, etc)
h.	DonationDate
i.	DonationAmount
j.	DonationMemo
Note: A single person may have zero, one, or several donations; but each donation has only one Type, Date, Amount, and Memo.
Bonus: write the SQL to create these tables in Oracle or MS SQL Server.

Please feel free to contact me to refine the requirements.  Don’t feel pressured to stay up all night and get this to me tomorrow.  I can wait a few days.
